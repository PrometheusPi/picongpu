/**
 * This is a 'quick & dirty' implementation of a plane wave background

 * 'Quick & dirty' means that much of the code is copy & pasted from the
 * TWTS background field implementation.
 * Along the lines of 'Whatever you do twice: Automate!' both 
 * implementations need to be refactored to outsource commonly used
